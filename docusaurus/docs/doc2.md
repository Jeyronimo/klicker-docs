Before a speech takes place the speaker creates questions and groups them within a session.
A session is the main tool of Klicker and consists of multiple blocks of at least one
question. During the speech (ongoing session) the speaker unlocks the question blocks so
that the audience can answer the questions within this block. The evaluation of the
questions may be viewed instantly and if desired shared with the audience.
