On the [Question Pool](doc4.md) screen, click _Create Question_ to add a new question.

Before preparing a session, all questions need to be created. Every question has the following
attributes that need to be filled:

1. **Question Title:** A short title that summarizes the question. The title is only visible for the speaker but not for the audience.

2. **Question Type:** Determines how a question can be answered by the audience:
   * _Single Choice (SC):_ Only one of the given answers may be selected.
   * _Multiple Choice (MC):_ Multiple of the given answers may be selected.
   * _Free Text (FT):_ The input is unrestricted (text answers).
   * _Number Range (NR):_ A number within a given range may be chosen (or any number, if no range is provided).

3. **Tags:** To group questions and simplify filtering, tags are used. Type in one or multiple tags or start typing and select an existing tag. Confirm by pressing Enter.

4. **Question:** The question to be answered by the audience.

5. **Available Choices (SC / MC only):** The available answers the audience may choose from. Click the plus sign (5.1) to add a new answer and type in the answer. Then click the red cross or green tick (5.2) to select whether the answer is correct or not and save the answer with the button on the right (5.3). Delete answers with the button on the left (5.4). **Notice that the buttons need to be clicked, as keyboard interactions are not yet fully working.**

6. **Input Restrictions (Number Range only):** The range the answer needs to be in. Either provide a lower and upper limit, only one of the said limits or no limit at all.

7. **Audience Preview:** A preview of how the audience sees the question.

8. **Save** Press the save button on the bottom to save the question and add it to the [Question Pool](doc4.md) (see next section).
