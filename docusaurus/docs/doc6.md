title: Session List
---

The session list is divided in three sections:

- **Running Session**: Only shows one session if a session is currently running.
- **Planned Sessions**: Shows all sessions that are created but not completed. These sessions can be started at any time.
- **Completed Sessions**: Shows all completed sessions. These sessions can not be started again but one can see the evaluation of the questions.
